# Machine_Learning_Texts_S14

## Project Description
For this project, I developed a system to filter and categorize movie reviews for the Film Junky Union. The objective was to train a model capable of detecting negative reviews automatically. Using a dataset of IMDB movie reviews labeled by sentiment polarity, I built a classifier to distinguish between positive and negative reviews, ensuring that the model achieved an F1 score of at least **0.85**.

## Project Instructions
1. **Loaded the data** from `imdb_reviews.tsv`.
2. **Preprocessed the data** as needed for analysis and modeling.
3. **Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed class distribution to assess any imbalance.
   - Visualized key insights.
4. **Prepared data for modeling**:
   - Converted text into numerical representations.
5. **Trained at least three different models** on the training dataset.
6. **Evaluated the models** on the test dataset.
7. **Classified custom reviews** using all trained models.
8. **Compared results** between test dataset classifications and custom review classifications.
9. **Presented findings** and discussed performance differences.
